# New Project

This project has been an emotional rollercoaster. Sleep is a distant memory, and my debugging skills are being pushed to the absolute limit. I have spent all my time spending all my energy on the ins and outs sof web programming. Fortunately, despite the chaos, there have been moments of triumph. I am not yet done -- to the instuctor's satisfcation or to mine -- but I feel proud for all the knowledge that I've acquired during this process.
